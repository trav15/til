# DynamoDB

## DynamoDB Streams

- DynamoDB Streams captures a time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications in any DynamoDB table and ***stores this information in a log for up to 24 hours***. Applications can access this log and view the data items as they appeared before and after they were modified, in near-real-time. 
- You can consume logs stored in DynamoDB streams in multiple ways. The most common approaches use AWS Lambda or a standalone application that uses the Kinesis Client Library (KCL) with the DynamoDB Streams Kinesis Adapter.

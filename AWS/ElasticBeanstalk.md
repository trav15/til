# AWS Elastic Beanstalk

AWS Elastic Beanstalk reduces management complexity without restricting choice or control. You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring. Elastic Beanstalk supports applications developed in Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. 

When you deploy your application, Elastic Beanstalk builds the selected supported platform version and provisions one or more AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, to run your application.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk for .NET makes it easier to deploy, manage, and scale your ASP.NET web applications that use Amazon Web Services. Elastic Beanstalk for .NET is available to anyone who is developing or hosting a web application that uses IIS.

With ElasticBeanstalk, you can:
- Select the operating system that matches your application requirements (e.g., Amazon Linux or Windows Server 2016)
- Choose from several Amazon EC2 instances, including On-Demand, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances.
- Choose from several available database and storage options.
- Enable login access to Amazon EC2 instances for immediate and direct troubleshooting
- Quickly improve application reliability by running in more than one Availability Zone.
- Enhance application security by enabling HTTPS protocol on the load balancer
- Access built-in Amazon CloudWatch monitoring and getting notifications on application health and other important events
- Adjust application server settings (e.g., JVM settings) and pass environment variables
- Run other application components, such as a memory caching service, side-by-side in Amazon EC2.
- Access log files without logging in to the application servers

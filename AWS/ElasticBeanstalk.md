# AWS Elastic Beanstalk

AWS Elastic Beanstalk reduces management complexity without restricting choice or control. You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring. Elastic Beanstalk supports applications developed in Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. 

When you deploy your application, Elastic Beanstalk builds the selected supported platform version and provisions one or more AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, to run your application.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk for .NET makes it easier to deploy, manage, and scale your ASP.NET web applications that use Amazon Web Services. Elastic Beanstalk for .NET is available to anyone who is developing or hosting a web application that uses IIS.

# Amazon Cognito

Amazon Cognito provides authentication, authorization, and user management for your web and mobile apps. Your users can sign in directly with a user name and password, or through a third party such as Facebook, Amazon, or Google.

The two main components of Amazon Cognito are user pools and identity pools. User pools are user directories that provide sign-up and sign-in options for your app users. Identity pools enable you to grant your users access to other AWS services. You can use identity pools and user pools separately or together.

Amazon Cognito identity pools (federated identities) support user authentication through Amazon Cognito user pools, federated identity providers—including Amazon, Facebook, Google, and SAML identity providers—as well as unauthenticated identities. This feature also supports [Developer Authenticated Identities (Identity Pools)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/developer-authenticated-identities.html), which lets you register and authenticate users via your own back-end authentication process.

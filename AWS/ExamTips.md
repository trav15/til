# Exam Tips

- Use **reverse flagging** to help build confidence while taking the exam
    - When you are *very sure* that an answer is correct *flag that question*. This is the opposite of flagging the questions that you are unsure about. It can build up your confidence to see yourself gain more flags rather than seeing a lot and trying to remove all of them. 
    
    Then go through the unflagged the questions for review (these are the questions you are unsure of). Don't skip the flagged ones and always check your work even if you are *certain* the answer is correct.

- Every 20-30 minutes give yourself a quick break to close your eyes and regain focus. It doesn't have to be a long break but the point is to clear your mind and refocus.

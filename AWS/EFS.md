# Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)

Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a fully-managed _file storage service_ that provides simple, scalable, elastic file storage for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. When mounted on Amazon EC2 instances, an Amazon EFS file system provides a standard file system interface and file system access semantics, allowing you to _seamlessly integrate Amazon EFS with your existing applications and tools_. Multiple Amazon EC2 instances can access an Amazon EFS file system at the same time, allowing Amazon EFS to provide a _common data source for workloads and applications running on more than one Amazon EC2 instance_.

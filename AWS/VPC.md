# VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a service that lets you launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 for most resources in your virtual private cloud, helping to ensure secure and easy access to resources and applications.

A **subnet** is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You can launch AWS resources into a specified subnet. When you create a VPC, you must specify a range of IPv4 addresses for the VPC in the form of a CIDR block. ***Each subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones***. You can also *optionally assign an IPv6 CIDR block to your VPC*, and assign IPv6 CIDR blocks to your subnets. Again, *IPv4 CIDRs are required*.

# AWS X-Ray

AWS X-Ray analyzes and debugs production, distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture. With X-Ray, you can identify performance bottlenecks, edge case errors, and other hard to detect issues.

AWS X-Ray can be used with applications running on Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, AWS Lambda, AWS Elastic Beanstalk. You just integrate the X-Ray SDK with your application and install the X-Ray agent.

AWS X-Ray provides an end-to-end, cross-service, application-centric view of requests flowing through your application by aggregating the data gathered from individual services in your application into a single unit called a trace.

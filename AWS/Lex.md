# Amazon Lex

Amazon Lex enables you to build applications using a speech or text interface powered by the same technology that powers Amazon Alexa. Amazon Lex provides the deep functionality and flexibility of natural language understanding (NLU) and automatic speech recognition (ASR), so you can build highly engaging user experiences with lifelike conversational interactions and create new categories of products.

Amazon Lex enables any developer to build conversational chatbots quickly. With Amazon Lex, no deep learning expertise is necessary—to create a bot, you just specify the basic conversation flow in the Amazon Lex console. The console provides a graphical user interface that you use to build a production-ready bot for your application.

After you create a bot, you deploy it on one of the supported platforms or integrate it into your own application. When a user interacts with the bot, the client application sends requests to the bot using the Amazon Lex runtime API. For example, when a user says “I want to order pizza,” your client sends this input to Amazon Lex using one of the runtime API operations. Users can provide input as speech or text.

You can also create Lambda functions and use them in an intent. Use these Lambda function code hooks to perform runtime activities such as initialization, validation of user input, and intent fulfillment.

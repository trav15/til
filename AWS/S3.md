# S3

## General
- Hot storage refers to the storage that keeps frequently accessed data (hot data). 
- Warm storage refers to the storage that keeps less frequently accessed data (warm data).
- Cold storage refers to the storage that keeps rarely accessed data (cold data). 

In terms of pricing, the colder the data, the cheaper it is to store, and the costlier it is to access when needed.

## Object Lock

With S3 Object Lock, you can store objects using a write-once-read-many (WORM) model. ***Object Lock can help prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely***. You can use Object Lock to help meet regulatory requirements that require WORM storage or to simply add another layer of protection against object changes and deletion.
- Before you lock any objects, ***you have to enable a bucket to use S3 Object Lock when you create a bucket***. After you enable Object Lock on a bucket, you can lock objects in that bucket. When you create a bucket with Object Lock enabled, you can’t disable Object Lock or suspend versioning for that bucket.

S3 Object Lock provides two retention modes: Governance mode and Compliance mode
- In **governance mode**, users can’t overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings *unless they have special permissions*. With governance mode, you protect objects against being deleted by most users, but you can still grant some users permission to alter the retention settings or delete the object if necessary. You can also use governance mode to test retention-period settings before creating a compliance-mode retention period.
- In **compliance mode**, a protected object version *can’t be overwritten or deleted by ANY USER*, including the root user in your AWS account. When an object is locked in compliance mode, its *retention mode can’t be changed, and its retention period can’t be shortened*. Compliance mode helps ensure that an object version can’t be overwritten or deleted for the duration of the retention period.

With Object Lock, you can also place a **legal hold** on an object version. Like a retention period, a legal hold prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted. However, a legal hold doesn’t have an associated retention period and remains in effect until removed. Legal holds can be freely placed and removed by any user who has the `s3:PutObjectLegalHold` permission.
- *​Legal holds are independent from retention periods*. As long as the bucket that contains the object has Object Lock enabled, you can place and remove legal holds regardless of whether the specified object version has a retention period set. ***Placing a legal hold on an object version doesn’t affect the retention mode or retention period for that object version***. You cannot set a time period for a legal hold. You can only do this using the “retention period” option.

## Signed URLs

In Amazon S3, *all objects are private by default*. Only the object owner has permission to access these objects. However, the object owner can optionally share objects with others by creating a **pre-signed URL**, using their own security credentials, *to grant time-limited permission to download the objects*.
- When you create a pre-signed URL for your object, you must provide your security credentials, specify a bucket name, an object key, specify the HTTP method (GET to download the object) and expiration date and time. The pre-signed URLs are valid only for the specified duration. Anyone who receives the pre-signed URL can then access the object.

## Encryption

***Server-side encryption protects data at rest***. If you use Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Encryption Keys (SSE-S3), Amazon S3 will encrypt each object with a unique key and as an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a master key that it rotates regularly. Amazon S3 server-side encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), to encrypt your data.
- ***If you need server-side encryption for all of the objects that are stored in a bucket, use a bucket policy***. For example, the following bucket policy denies permissions to upload an object unless the request includes the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header to request server-side encryption:
- However, if you choose to use server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C), you must provide encryption key information using the following request headers:
    - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`
    - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`
    - `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`

## Static website hosting

Below are the prerequisites for routing traffic to a website that is hosted in an Amazon S3 Bucket:
- An S3 bucket that is configured to host a static website. The ***bucket must have the same name as your domain or subdomain***. For example, if you want to use the subdomain portal.thisexample.com, the name of the bucket must be portal.thisexample.com.
- A registered domain name. You can use Route 53 as your domain registrar, or you can use a different registrar.
- *Route 53 as the DNS service for the domain*. If you register your domain name by using Route 53, we automatically configure Route 53 as the DNS service for the domain.

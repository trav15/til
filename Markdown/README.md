# Markdown

Layout tips:
- Use blank lines between before and after headings
```
Try to put a blank line before...

# Heading

...and after a heading.
```

- Don't put tabs or spaces in front of paragraphs
- Use asterisks (\**) for **bolding** instead of underscores because MD apps don't agree on how to handle underscores in the middle of a word.
